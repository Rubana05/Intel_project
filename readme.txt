1. created a dataset with 500 samples and 3 clusters using the make_blobs function. 
After visualizing the dataset with a scatter plot, analyze the distribution of points. 
How many distinct clusters do you observe? Which clustering algorithm would be suitable 
for grouping the data points? Additionally, how can you determine the optimal number of
clusters programmatically?
