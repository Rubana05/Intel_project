1. created a dataset with 500 samples and 3 clusters using the make_blobs function. 
After visualizing the dataset with a scatter plot, analyze the distribution of points. 
How many distinct clusters do you observe? Which clustering algorithm would be suitable 
for grouping the data points? Additionally, how can you determine the optimal number of
clusters programmatically?

2.The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset containing 150 samples of iris flowers categorized into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample is represented by four features: Sepal Length Sepal Width Petal Length Petal Width.
i)To develop a machine learning model using the Decision tree algorithm to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on sepal and petal dimensions.
ii)To develop a machine learning model using the K th cluster algorithm to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on sepal and petal dimensions. 
iii)To develop a machine learning model using the Random forest algorithm to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on sepal and petal dimensions.

OUTPUT: i) Decision Tree Model Accuracy: 1.00 
Prediction for new sample: virginica 
ii)Predicted Cluster: 0 
Prediction for new sample: setosa
iii)Random Forest Model Accuracy: 1.00 
Prediction for new sample: virginica
